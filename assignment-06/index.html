        <li>1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice</li>

    <h1>
        Directions
    </h1>

    <ol>
        <!-- used the sup as a semantic element-->
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425<sup>o</sup> F.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush the gluten-free cinnamon Chex cereal in a food processor until you have 2 cups.</li>
        <li>Add gluten-free Bisquick and chopped butter (dairy-free use Smart Balance butter) in the food processor.
            Process until the consistency of thick sand.</li>
        <li>Pour the Chex mixture into a bowl. Add the ice water and mix with your hands until a compact dough has
            formed. Refrigerate while making the pie filling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Pumpkin Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl beat eggs and sugar together.</li>
        <li>Add cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and vanilla and mix until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Add pumpkin and mix until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in evaporated milk and mix until fully combined. Dairy-free use 1 cup of canned coconut milk (full
            fat).</li>
        <li>Spay 9-inch pie dish with gluten-free cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Press the dough into the pie dish.</li>
        <li>Using the middle rack, bake for 5 minutes at 425° F.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and pour pumpkin pie filling into the pie crust. Depending on how deep your pie pan is, you
            may have a little of the filling left over. I always pour it into a custard cup and bake it.</li>
        <li>Using the middle rack bake for 15 minutes at 425° F and then lower the heat to 350° F and bake for an
            additional 40 to 50 minutes. Please watch your pie and if the crust is getting too brown for your liking
            cover crust edges with foil.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool before serving. I like to allow the pie to cool for at least 1 hour before I refrigerate the
            pie. It's best served cold.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or cold with whipped cream. Enjoy!</li>
        <li>Once cooled cover and refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>
