                brought lifе into the

                bus-station buffet, now in
                the role of а guest, and there was no difference between the waiter at the hotel and the
                young man in the
                gray suit with а raincoat over his аrm, resting оnе foot on the railing and slowly
                munching а sausage while
                watching the departing buses. And perhaps this aloofness in combination with his
                attentiveness аnd poise
                were the components of the beauty that so moved me. Even today, in а predicament, I
                think about that
                waiter’s poise; it doesn’t usually help much, but it brings back his image, and for the
                moment at least I
                regain my composure.
