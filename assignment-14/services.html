                <p><strong>Peter Handke</strong> (German pronunciation: [ˈpeːtɐ ˈhantkə]; born 6 December 1942) is a Nobel laureate
                novelist, playwright, translator, poet, film director, and screenwriter from Austria. Handke was awarded
                the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2019.[1]</p>

                <p>In the late 1960s, he was recognized for the play Publikumsbeschimpfung (Offending the Audience) and the
                novel Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter (The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick). Prompted by his
                mother's suicide in 1971, he reflected her life in the novel Wunschloses Unglück (A Sorrow Beyond
                Dreams). Handke was a member of the Grazer Gruppe (an association of authors) and the Grazer
                Autorenversammlung, and co-founded the Verlag der Autoren publishing house in Frankfurt. He collaborated
                with director Wim Wenders, leading to screenplays such as Der Himmel über Berlin (Wings of Desire).</p>

                <h4>Early Life and Family</h4>
                <p>Handke was born in Griffen, then in the German Reich's province Gau Carinthia.[2] His father, Erich
                    Schönemann, was a bank clerk and German soldier whom Handke did not meet until adulthood. His mother
                    Maria, a Carinthian Slovene, married Bruno Handke, a tram conductor and Wehrmacht soldier from
                    Berlin, before Peter was born.[3] The family lived in the Soviet-occupied Pankow district of Berlin
                    from 1944 to 1948, where Maria Handke had two more children: Peter's half-sister and half-brother.
                    Then the family moved to his mother's home town of Griffen. Peter experienced his stepfather as more
                    and more violent due to alcoholism.[3]</p>

                <p>In 1954, Handke was sent to the Catholic Marianum boys' boarding school at Tanzenberg Castle in Sankt
                    Veit an der Glan. There, he published his first writing in the school newspaper, Fackel.[3] In 1959,
                    he moved to Klagenfurt, where he went to high school, and commenced law studies at the University of
                    Graz in 1961.[2]</p>

                <p>Handke's mother took her own life in 1971, reflected in his novel Wunschloses Unglück (A Sorrow
                    Beyond Dreams).[2][4]</p>

                <p>After leaving Graz, Handke lived in Düsseldorf, Berlin, Kronberg, Paris, the U.S. (1978 to 1979) and
                    Salzburg (1979 to 1988).[5] Since 1990, he has resided in Chaville near Paris.[6] He is the subject
                    of the documentary film Peter Handke: In the Woods, Might Be Late (2016), directed by Corinna Belz
                    [de].[7] Since 2012, Handke has been a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.[8] He is
                    a member of the Serbian Orthodox church.[9][10]</p>

                <p>As of early November 2019, there was an official investigation by the relevant authorities on whether
                    Handke may have automatically lost his Austrian citizenship upon obtaining a Yugoslav passport and
                    nationality in the late 1990s.[11]</p>

                <h4>Career</h4>
                <p>While studying, Handke established himself as a writer, linking up with the Grazer Gruppe (the Graz
                    Authors' Assembly), an association of young writers.[5] The group published a magazine on
                    literature, manuskripte [de], which published Handke's early works.[2] Group members included
                    Wolfgang Bauer and Barbara Frischmuth.[12]</p>

                <p>Handke abandoned his studies in 1965,[2] after the German publishing house Suhrkamp Verlag accepted
                    his novel Die Hornissen [de] (The Hornets) for publication.[13] He gained international attention
                    after an appearance at a meeting of avant-garde artists belonging to the Gruppe 47 in Princeton, New
                    Jersey, in 1966.[14] The same year, his play Publikumsbeschimpfung (Offending the Audience)
                    premiered at the Theater am Turm [de] in Frankfurt, directed by Claus Peymann [de].[13][14] Handke
                    became one of the co-founders of the publishing house Verlag der Autoren [de] in 1969 with a new
                    commercial concept, as it belonged to the authors.[15] He co-founded the Grazer Autorenversammlung
                    in 1973[16] and was a member until 1977.[5]</p>

                <p>Handke's first play, Publikumsbeschimpfung (Offending the Audience), which premiered in Frankfurt in
                    1966 and made him well known,[14] was the first of several experimental plays without a conventional
                    plot.[2] In his second play, Kaspar, he treated the story of Kaspar Hauser as "an allegory of
                    conformist social pressures".[14]</p>

                <p>Handke has written scripts for films.[5] He directed Die linkshändige Frau (The Left-Handed Woman),
                    which was released in 1978. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide's description of the film is that a woman
                    demands that her husband leave and he complies. "Time passes... and the audience falls asleep." The
                    film was nominated for the Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1978 and won the Gold
                    Award for German Arthouse Cinema in 1980. Handke also won the 1975 German Film Award in Gold for his
                    screenplay for Falsche Bewegung (The Wrong Move). He collaborated with director Wim Wenders in
                    writing the screenplay for the 1987 film Der Himmel über Berlin (Wings of Desire), including the
                    poem at its opening. Since 1975, Handke has been a jury member of the European literary award
                    Petrarca-Preis.[17]</p>

                <p>Handke collaborated with director Wim Wenders on a film version of Die Angst des Tormanns beim
                    Elfmeter, wrote the script for Falsche Bewegung (The Wrong Move) and co-wrote the screenplay for Der
                    Himmel über Berlin (Wings of Desire) and Les Beaux Jours d'Aranjuez (The Beautiful Days of
                    Aranjuez). He also directed films, including adaptations from his novels The Left-Handed Woman after
                    Die linkshändige Frau, and The Absence after Die Abwesenheit.[2][5]</p>

                <p>In 2019, Handke was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature "for an influential work that with
                    linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience."[1]</p>
